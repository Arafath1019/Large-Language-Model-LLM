# LLM Engineering Master AI, Large Language Models & Agents

### Setting Up Ollama for Local LLM Deployment on Windows and Mac (Same process on both)

- Download and install Ollama: https://ollama.com/
- Run model: ollama run model_name
- List installed models in Ollama: ollama list
- Remove a specific model: ollama rm model_name
- List of models to play: https://ollama.com/search

### LLM Engineering Roadmap From Beginner to Master

- Week 1: What a time to be working with LLMs
- Week 2: Frontier Models with UIs. Agentization and Multi-modality
- Week 3: Open source with HuggingFace
- Week 4: Selecting LLMs and Code Generation
- Week 5: RAG and Question Answering - Creating an Expert
- Week 6: Fine-tuning a Frontier Model
- Week 7: Fine-tuning an Open-Source Model
- Week 8: The Final - mastering LLM engineering

### Buildimg LLM Applications

- Chatbots
- RAG
- Agentic AI Projects

### Settings up LLM Development Environment Tools and Best Practices

Will understand Frontier Models and their APIs and will have coded own solutions

- Day 1: First LLM Solutions from scratch
- Day 2: Best positioning for success in 8 weeks
- Day 3: State of the art-comparing Frontier models
- Day 4: Transformers
- Day 5: A powerful solution in a matter of minutes

Creating a full powered Data Science Environment:

- Step 1: Clone the repo
- Step 2: Follow the README: Recommended: Create an Anaconda environment, Alternative: Use Python virtual environment and pip
- Step 3: Create an OpenAI key
- Step 4: Create the .env file
- Step 5: Activate environment and run Jupyter Lab

### Mac Setup Guide Jupyter Lab and Conda for LLM Projects

- Ed-Donner LLM Engineering Github Repo: https://github.com/ed-donner/llm_engineering

Steps:

1. Clone or Download the repo: https://github.com/ed-donner/llm_engineering
2. Download & Install Anaconda for mac: https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install
3. To download all the necessary dependencies and environment setup, Navigate to llm_engineering folder using terminal and run the command: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
4. To activate the environment, run: `conda activate llms`
5. To launch data science environment, Jupyter lab run: `jupyter lab`
