### Settings up LLM Development Environment Tools and Best Practices

Will understand Frontier Models and their APIs and will have coded own solutions

- Day 1: First LLM Solutions from scratch
- Day 2: Best positioning for success in 8 weeks
- Day 3: State of the art-comparing Frontier models
- Day 4: Transformers
- Day 5: A powerful solution in a matter of minutes

Creating a full powered Data Science Environment:

- Step 1: Clone the repo
- Step 2: Follow the README: Recommended: Create an Anaconda environment, Alternative: Use Python virtual environment and pip
- Step 3: Create an OpenAI key
- Step 4: Create the .env file
- Step 5: Activate environment and run Jupyter Lab
